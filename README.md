# demo

## Setup

- Clone the repo: `$ git clone git@github.com:jmboiton/demo.git`
- Install dependencies: `$ npm install`

## Task1: Markup and ReactJS

The project has the following scripts:

| Syntax              | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$ npm start`       | Builds the source code and launches a local server to preview a production ready version of the demo.     |
| `$ npm run dev`     | Launches a local server for development. The demo can be tested with this, but it won't be optimized.     |
| `$ npm run build`   | Builds the source code (e.g. transform TS to optimized JS) and place the result in a `/dist` folder.      |
| `$ npm run preview` | Launches a local server to serve the contents of the `/dist` folder (i.e. the result of `npm run build`). |

The project comes equiped with other scripts for linting and testing, but there are not tests jet.

## Task2: Javascript

- Copy and paste the contests of the [/task2/index.js](task2/index.js) file into the browser console.
